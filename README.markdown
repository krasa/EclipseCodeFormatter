# Adapter for Eclipse Code Formatter [![Donate][badge-paypal-img]][badge-paypal]

Allows using Eclipse's Java code formatter directly from IntelliJ. Solves the problem of maintaining a common code style
in team environments where both IDEA and Eclipse are used.

***Note:*** This project utilizes (and in some manners modifies) code licensed under [EPL-2.0](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/epl-2.0/EPL-2.0.html). For more information see [lib/eclipse](lib/eclipse/README.md).

## Instructions

1. Install the plugin
    - [Tutorial: Installing, Updating and Uninstalling Repository Plugins](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/webhelp/installing-updating-and-uninstalling-repository-plugins.html)
    - [Plugin repository page](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?idea&id=6546)
2. Configure it
    1. Configure Eclipse location (optional)
        - Install Eclipse
        - Got To IntelliJ Settings | Other Settings | Adapter for Eclipse Code Formatter
        - Set `Eclipse installation folder` (`/Users/xxx/Eclipse.app/Contents/Eclipse` for Mac)
        - Change `Java formatter version` to `Configured Eclipse installation folder`
    2. Configure formatter
        - Either, export formatter profiles to get a `*.xml` file
            1. Go to `Eclipse | Windows | Preferences | Java | Code Style | Formatter`
            2. Eclipse does not export default profiles, so you have to make your own via the `New` button
            3. Export the profile via the `Export all...` button
                - The result should look
                  like [this](https://github.com/krasa/EclipseCodeFormatter/blob/master/test/resources/format.xml)

        - Or, enable project specific formatter settings to get `org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs`
            1. With your project open in Eclipse's workspace, `right-click` the project and choose Properties
            2. Go to `Java Code Style | Formatter` and select `Enable project specific settings`
            3. Click `OK` to save the settings
            4. Go to the `.settings` directory inside your project's directory. There you will find
               the `org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs` file which contains the Eclipse formatter settings
                - The result should look
                  like [this](https://github.com/krasa/EclipseCodeFormatter/blob/master/test/resources/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs)
        - Or, export a [Workspace Mechanic](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/workspace-mechanic/) configuration to
          get a `*.epf` file
            - The result should look
              like [this](https://github.com/krasa/EclipseCodeFormatter/blob/master/test/resources/mechanic-formatter.epf)

        - Open a project in IntelliJ
        - Set path to the config file
          via `IntelliJ | Settings | Other Settings | Adapter for Eclipse Code Formatter | Eclipse preference file`
        - When using exported profiles (the xml file), select desired profile in the combobox `Java formatter profile`
    3. Check `Optimizing Imports` configuration
        - Set import order
            - Either, leave the default
            - Or, set path to Eclipse configuration file:
                - Go to `Eclipse | Windows | Preferences | Java | Code Style | Organize Imports`
                    - Either, click on `Export...`
                      , ([example](https://github.com/krasa/EclipseCodeFormatter/blob/master/test/resources/bcjur2.importorder))
                    - Or, enable project specific settings and use `org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs` file which should contain
                      the line `org.eclipse.jdt.ui.importorder=...`
        - Set the value of `Class count to use import with` and `Name count to use static import with`
          in `Settings | Editor | Code Style | Java | Imports` for Idea 14 or `Settings | Editor | Code Style | Imports`
          for older Idea. Eclipse uses 99 by default
        - For versions lower than 4.0 - make sure to disable IntelliJ's `Import Optimizing` in the reformat dialog
          via `Settings | Editor | Show "Reformat Code" dialog`. The plugin will take care of imports anyway
        - For versions higher than 4.0 - imports will be reordered together with normal IntelliJ's import optimizing
        - **Disable `Optimize imports on the fly`**
3. Format code as usual, notice the green bubble notification about successful formatting 
   -  notifications can be disabled at `Settings | Appearance & Behavior | Notifications`
4. Use `Ctrl + Alt + O` as usual, it will use this plugin
5. Use ``Ctrl + ` `` for quick switch between formatters in `Switch Code Formatter` or `View | Quick Switch Scheme...`

## Possible problems with Java formatting
- `@formatter:off` is not working
   See: https://github.com/krasa/EclipseCodeFormatter/issues/64
- Nothing was formatted or formatting failed 
  - Make sure you are using proper language level in `Main Menu | File | Project Structure`
- Trailing spaces inside javadocs are stripped
  - Set `Strip trailing spaces on save` to `None`
- File is formatted differently
  - The file is actually formatted fine, it just looks different in the editor, as the tab size and indendation are set differently in IntelliJ in `Settings | Editor | Code Style | Java` than in Eclipse. Using of either tab only or space only whitespace is recommended.
  - Or it is a bug
- Eclipse indendation is configured for 2 spaces, but a new line gets indented by 4 spaces when Enter is pressed.
  - Change code style in IntelliJ. Not all things get formatted by this plugin when you type them.
